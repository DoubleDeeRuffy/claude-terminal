## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Restored terminal tabs scroll to bottom on app restart
expected: After restarting the app with existing terminal sessions, every restored terminal tab shows the most recent output at the very bottom of the viewport — not stuck at a mid-session scroll position.
result: skipped
reason: Same issue as test 2 — race condition with loading

### 2. Resumed Claude session scrolls to bottom after history replay
expected: A Claude terminal tab that resumes with --resume dismisses its loading overlay and the terminal is scrolled to the very bottom, showing the latest prompt/output line.
result: issue
reported: "same issue as test 1 - not perfect, race condition with loading still happening after resume"
severity: major

### 3. Chat-mode tabs produce no errors
expected: If any chat-mode tabs exist, the app restarts without JavaScript errors related to scrollToBottom (no TypeError on null terminal). Check DevTools console.
result: skipped

### 4. Non-active restored tabs scroll to bottom when switched to
expected: After restart, switch between different restored terminal tabs. Each tab you switch to should already be scrolled to the bottom showing the most recent output.
result: issue
reported: "same race condition as test 2 - scroll fires before content fully loaded"
severity: major

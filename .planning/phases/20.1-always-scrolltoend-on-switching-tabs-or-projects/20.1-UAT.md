## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Auto-scroll to bottom on terminal tab switch
expected: Open a project with multiple terminal tabs. Scroll up in one terminal so you're NOT at the bottom. Switch to another terminal tab, then switch back. The terminal should automatically scroll to the bottom (latest output).
result: pass

### 2. Auto-scroll to bottom on project switch
expected: Have two projects open with terminals. Scroll up in one project's terminal. Switch to the other project, then switch back. The terminal should auto-scroll to the bottom.
result: pass

### 3. Settings toggle present and default-enabled
expected: Open Settings panel. In the Terminal group, there should be an "Auto-scroll on switch" toggle (or similar label). It should be checked/enabled by default.
result: pass

### 4. Disabling toggle preserves scroll position
expected: Turn OFF the auto-scroll toggle in Settings. Scroll up in a terminal. Switch tabs and switch back. The terminal should stay at the scroll position where you left it (NOT jump to bottom).
result: pass

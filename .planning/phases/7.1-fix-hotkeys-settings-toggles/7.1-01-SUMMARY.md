# Phase 7.1 Plan 01: Fix Hotkeys Settings Toggles Summary

**Fixed CSS class mismatch on terminal shortcut toggles — changed `terminal-shortcut-toggle` to `toggle-option` so checkboxes render as styled pill switches identical to all other settings toggles**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-25T14:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-25T14:34:43Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Identified class mismatch: label used `terminal-shortcut-toggle` while settings.css only defines `.toggle-option` styles
- Changed both occurrences in ShortcutsManager.js (label class + closest() selector) to `toggle-option`
- Rebuilt renderer bundle — build succeeded, 262 tests pass with no regressions

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Change toggle label class from terminal-shortcut-toggle to toggle-option** - `af3adf1` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Build renderer bundle and run tests** - No separate commit (dist/ is gitignored; build success verified)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/renderer/ui/panels/ShortcutsManager.js` - Changed label class `terminal-shortcut-toggle` -> `toggle-option` on line 277; updated `closest()` selector on line 429

## Decisions Made
- `terminal-shortcut-checkbox` class on the `<input>` was intentionally left unchanged — it is only referenced in JS querySelector calls, not in CSS, so renaming it would break JS without fixing anything
- No CSS changes were needed — `settings.css` already has full `.toggle-option` styles (44x24px pill, accent color, white slider circle)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- `dist/` directory is gitignored, so the renderer bundle rebuild (Task 2) produces no git-tracked changes. The build still succeeded and tests passed — criteria met.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Terminal shortcut toggles now render as styled pill switches matching all other settings toggles
- Phase 7.1 complete — ready for Phase 10 (Adjust Tab Renaming)

# Phase 6.3: Remember Active Task on Project Scope - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Persist which terminal tab was last active per project, and restore it on both project-swap and app restart. The user should land on exactly the tab they were last working in when returning to a project.

## Implementation Decisions

### What to remember
- Active terminal tab only (not panels, scroll position, or modals)
- Stored per-project scope — each project remembers its own last active tab

### Restore behavior
- Auto-focus the remembered tab when switching to a project
- Identical behavior for both project-swap and app restart — no distinction
- If the remembered tab no longer exists (was closed), fall back to the first available tab

### Claude's Discretion
- Storage mechanism (extend existing session data or add new field)
- When to persist the active tab (on every tab switch, debounced, or on project-leave)
- How to identify tabs across restarts (terminal ID, index, or other stable identifier)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches. The key expectation is seamless continuity: switching projects or restarting the app should feel like picking up exactly where you left off.

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope

## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Active tab restored on project switch
expected: Switch to Project A, select the 2nd or 3rd terminal tab. Switch to Project B, select a different tab. Switch back to Project A — the tab you last had active should be re-selected, not the first tab.
result: pass

### 2. Active tab restored on app restart
expected: Open a project with 2+ terminal tabs. Select a non-first tab (e.g., the 3rd). Close and restart the app. The same tab (3rd) should be active when the project loads.
result: issue
reported: "the active tab is restored, but the session is not resumed!"
severity: major

### 3. Fallback when saved tab no longer exists
expected: Open a project with 3+ tabs. Select the 3rd tab. Close 2 tabs so only 1 remains. Switch away to another project and switch back — the remaining tab should be active (no blank state, no crash).
result: skipped

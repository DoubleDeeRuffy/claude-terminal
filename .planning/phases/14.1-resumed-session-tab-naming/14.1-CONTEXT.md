# Phase 14.1: Resumed Session Tab Naming - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

When a user resumes a Claude session via the resume dialog (Phase 14), the new tab should be named with the original session name from that dialog entry. Currently the tab shows "Resume..." and may not get a proper name. This phase wires the session name from the resume dialog through to the tab name. App-restart tab restore (Phase 16) already handles name persistence — this phase covers only the manual resume-from-dialog path.

## Implementation Decisions

### Naming source
- Restore the original tab name from the resume dialog data (same data Phase 10.1 shows in the picker)
- Name applies after the session connects, not immediately on tab creation — tab shows "Resume..." during connection (current behavior)
- If the original tab had no custom name (still "Terminal N" or default), keep that default name as-is — no AI rename triggered

### Name persistence
- The name is already stored in the resume dialog's data source — no need to re-persist after patching it into the tab
- Manual rename after resume overrides the restored name permanently — standard rename behavior

### Display format
- No visual distinction between resumed tabs and fresh tabs once the name is patched in
- No additional loading indicator during the "Resume..." phase — keep current behavior unchanged

### Resume dialog data flow
- Resume dialog passes the session name to the tab creation flow directly (in the callback/event, not looked up separately)
- This is dialog-resume only — app-restart restore already implemented in Phase 16

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact event/callback shape for passing the name from dialog to tab creation
- Where to hook the name patch (SESSION_START event vs direct callback)
- Error handling if session name is missing or empty

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- The resume dialog already displays session names (Phase 10.1) — that same data should be the source of truth for the tab name
- "Resume..." is the current tab text during connection — keep that as the interim state, then patch to saved name once connected

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope

## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Resume renamed session (terminal mode)
expected: Open the resume dialog, click a session card that has a custom name (accent-colored title). The new terminal tab should immediately show that session's saved name.
result: issue
reported: "Resumeing... stays for ever for default name and for known name of resumed session"
severity: major

### 2. Resume un-renamed session (terminal mode)
expected: Open the resume dialog, click a session card that does NOT have a custom name (no accent color on title, shows auto-derived summary text). The new terminal tab should show "Resume..." as interim text (existing behavior unchanged).
result: pass

### 3. Resume renamed session (chat mode)
expected: Switch to chat mode, open the resume dialog, click a session card that has a custom name. The new chat tab should display the session's saved name — not the project name.
result: skipped
reason: User skipped

## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Resume renamed session (terminal mode, lightbulb)
expected: Open the lightbulb resume dialog, click a session card that has a custom name. The new terminal tab should immediately show that session's saved name — not "Resuming...".
result: pass
notes: Fixed by patching showSessionsModal() in renderer.js to pass session.displayTitle as name to resumeSession(), and adding session-names.json lookup to _preprocessModalSessions().

### 2. Resume un-renamed session (terminal mode, lightbulb)
expected: Open the lightbulb resume dialog, click a session card without a custom name. The tab should show "Resuming..." as interim, then get a name when Claude next emits a task title.
result: pass

### 3. Resume renamed session (chat mode)
expected: Switch to chat mode, open the resume dialog, click a session card with a custom name. The new chat tab should display the session's saved name.
result: skipped
reason: User skipped

# Phase 14.1: Resumed Session Tab Naming Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Thread the saved session name from the resume dialog through to the tab name when resuming a Claude session, so resumed tabs display their original name instead of staying as "Resume..."
**Verified:** 2026-02-27T12:30:00Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | When user clicks a session card with isRenamed=true, the new tab displays that exact saved name | VERIFIED | Line 2858: `const sessionName = (session?.isRenamed && session?.displayTitle) ? session.displayTitle : null;` — isRenamed guard extracts displayTitle; lines 2974 and 2992 apply it to termData.name and tab DOM span |
| 2 | When user clicks a session card with isRenamed=false (or no custom name), tab shows 'Resume...' interim text then default naming behavior | VERIFIED | Lines 2974 and 2992 both use `sessionName \|\| t('terminals.resuming')` — null sessionName falls back to i18n key, preserving existing behavior |
| 3 | Tab name set from resume dialog can be overridden by manual rename (standard behavior unchanged) | VERIFIED | No changes were made to the rename handlers or OSC title update paths — the tab-naming flow after creation is unmodified |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `src/renderer/ui/components/TerminalManager.js` | Session name threading from resume dialog card click through resumeSession to tab creation | VERIFIED | File modified with all required changes. 562 tests pass. Build succeeds (confirmed by SUMMARY). |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `renderSessionsPanel` card click handler | `resumeSession` options | `session?.isRenamed && session?.displayTitle` | WIRED | Line 2858-2859: guard evaluates isRenamed, extracts displayTitle, passes as `name: sessionName` to resumeSession |
| `resumeSession` | terminal-mode `termData.name` and tab DOM span | `sessionName` destructured from options | WIRED | Line 2925: destructures `name: sessionName = null`; line 2974: `name: sessionName \|\| t('terminals.resuming')`; line 2992: DOM span uses same pattern |
| `resumeSession` | `createChatTerminal` | `name: sessionName` passed through options | WIRED | Line 2931: `createChatTerminal(project, { skipPermissions, resumeSessionId: sessionId, name: sessionName })` — createChatTerminal already handles `name` via `customName` destructuring (line 3790) |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SESS-RESUME-01 | 14.1-01-PLAN.md | User can resume a previous Claude session from a visible button in the terminal toolbar | SATISFIED (partial — button delivered by Phase 14, 14.1 adds name threading) | Resume button confirmed at `index.html:285` (`btn-resume-session`). The name-threading component of this requirement is implemented in TerminalManager.js. |
| TAB-RESUME-01 | 14.1-01-PLAN.md | Resume session dialog displays saved tab names (from AI haiku, slash commands, or manual renames) instead of "Untitled conversation", with readable accent-colored metadata | SATISFIED | `displayTitle` shown in card at line 2679; `session-card--renamed` CSS class applied at line 2669 with accent color styling in projects.css:1245-1247; name threaded to tab via sessionName pattern |

**Traceability table discrepancy noted:** REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (line 140) maps SESS-RESUME-01 to Phase 14 and TAB-RESUME-01 to Phase 19 with status "Planned". The ROADMAP.md is authoritative and assigns both to Phase 14.1. The traceability table is stale and should be updated to reflect Phase 14.1 and status "Complete".

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns found. Scanned for TODO/FIXME/placeholder/empty implementations in the modified lines. The implementation is substantive with proper guard logic, fallback patterns, and both code paths (terminal-mode and chat-mode) handled.

### Commit Verification

Both commits from SUMMARY exist in the repository:

- `b19356ab` — feat(14.1-01): thread session name from card click to resumeSession
- `e6cb9d01` — feat(14.1-01): apply session name to tab creation in terminal and chat modes

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Resume a renamed session in terminal mode

**Test:** Open the app. Select a project that has at least one previous Claude session with a custom name (shown with accent-colored title in the resume dialog). Click its card.
**Expected:** The new terminal tab appears immediately with the session's saved name (e.g., "Fix login bug") rather than "Resume...".
**Why human:** Requires live Electron with Claude Code sessions on disk and the PTY resume flow completing.

#### 2. Resume an un-renamed session in terminal mode

**Test:** Open the resume dialog for a project with a session that has no custom name (title derived from summary or prompt snippet — NOT accent-colored). Click its card.
**Expected:** The new terminal tab shows "Resume..." initially. The tab may later get a name via OSC title escape or haiku AI rename (normal post-resume behavior).
**Why human:** Requires live Electron with a session that has `isRenamed=false` in session-names.json to confirm the null fallback path works.

#### 3. Resume a renamed session in chat mode

**Test:** In Settings, set Terminal Mode to "Chat". Open the resume dialog. Click a renamed session card.
**Expected:** The new chat tab displays the session's saved name instead of the project name default.
**Why human:** Requires running Electron with chat mode active and Claude Code session available.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All three observable truths are verified by direct code inspection. Both key links are wired end-to-end. The single modified artifact exists, is substantive, and is integrated into the function call chain. 562 tests pass. The only outstanding items require live human testing in the running Electron app.
